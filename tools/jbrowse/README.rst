JBrowse to container
====================

    JBrowse is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with
    JavaScript and HTML5

This tool is only useful when running both JBrowse and Galaxy containers as done
in the
`Galaxy Genome Annotation dockerized GMOD deployment example <https://github.com/galaxy-genome-annotation/dockerized-gmod-deployment>`__
